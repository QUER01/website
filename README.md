Welcome to my git repository of my personal website.
This blog is intended to share my personal thoughts about data science and data engineering problems and tasks.

This website is purely based on html5, css and js. So everything is based on the git repo listed under "Copyright and License" and further developed. This helped me to gain more insights into web-application developing.
